# Additional Documentation and Customizations for VisiData

[VisiData](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata) is a powerful,
terminal/curses-based data filtering and analysis program.  This repo
is for extensions to the existing VisiData documentaton.

# Cheatsheet

[This rsw-cheatsheet](https://github.com/rswgnu/rsw-visidata/master/rsw-cheatsheet.org)
takes the [original
cheatsheet](https://jsvine.github.io/visidata-cheat-sheet/en/),
reorganizes it, extends it with additional advanced data manipulation
sections and converts it into a text-only file format (Emacs .org
outline and table format).  This might make a great replacement for
the man page help bound to Control-h in VisiData.

# Emacs Keybindings

[This .visidatarc file](.visidatarc) is a still in-progress emulation
of basic Emacs movement commands within VisiData so that Emacs users
can navigate VisiData faster and focus on the data wrangling aspects
quicker.
